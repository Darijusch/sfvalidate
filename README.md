# sfvalidate

Trying to make a library which will be from the constraints compatible 
to the symfony ones, to use the same validators on frontend as on backend.

TODOs
----- 
- remove whole lodash (currently only get is left)
- add more symfony validators
- add more handling when passing invalid datatypes for parameters/values
