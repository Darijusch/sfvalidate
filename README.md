# validari

validari is a library to validate objects, i came up with the name from valid + dari which is my nickname, so i merged it into validari. The goal of the library is to provide some of the core features of symfony validation, in terms of constraints, group validation and error messages. Maybe in the near future i will provide a php library which will create out of entities with symfony validation, javascript rules for this library and having the benefit of using frontend and backend the same constraints, settings and messages. This is much more user friendly and the maintance is lowered as well since changing constraints or options only on side and let it autogenerate the counterpart.
